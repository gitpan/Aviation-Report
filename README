Background

    This is the README file for Aviation::Report.

    The current version is 1.01. It was released on Oct 6, 1998.
    When you find bugs, I'd appreciate a mail message to let me know what's
    wrong.

    Aviation::Report as been developed and tested on Linux as well as Windows NT
    using the "native" port of Perl.

    U.S. Aviation METAR, TAF and PIREP textual reports are translated into
    plain English. Some effort is made to translate the remarks fields
    of METAR and TAF reports.

Installation

    Installing Aviation::Report is an easy process.

      % perl Makefile.PL
      % make
      % make test
      % make install

Documentation

    The documentation is built-in to the Report module in POD format.
    You can use any of the pod2* converters to translate it to a more
    readable format. The three most common formats are 'man', 'html',
    and 'text'.

See Also

    Jeremy Zawodny has an OO module called METAR.pm that builds an internal
    data structure of non-remarks tokens.
